Module 4 Challenge - Written Report

The data analysis shows that overall Charter schools are more successfuly in showing academic growth. Overall, there is a 90% overall passing rate for Charter schools while only 53% of District school students are passing overall. The data suggests that any school under 2,000 has a higher passing rate. Interestingly, the amount of money spend by a school per student had a reverse correlation. It would be assumed that more money spent on a student would lead to greater success. However, the data suggests that this is not necessarily true. 

Another point of intrest is that the schools that spend less money, mainly Charter schools, have a higher overall passing rate. Thomas High School spend more money than other Charter schools. Their results were similar to other Charter schools that spend less money.

A further analysis into the socio-economics of the schools and a look into significant differences between District and Charter schools would help one better understand or identify what factors may be of imoprtance for academic success. According to the data, the argument for educational improvement through the increase of funding is not coherent. 

For this assignment, I utilized help from the activities in 3.Activities, the "Reading, Writing, and Pyrtihmetic," and "Python Deeper Dive" class recordings, and the homework solutions.
